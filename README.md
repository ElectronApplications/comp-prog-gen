# About the project
This is a small script I wrote, so I can easily generate code for [my contests on Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/ElectronApps) and be able to solve tasks without worrying about unnecessary details.
It can be supplied with custom templates in different programming languages and allows for modular generation of code by choosing only the modules that would be needed for specific tasks.  
The script is written in python, so you'll need it installed. Then it can simply be run with `cpgen` or `python cpgen` and help will be displayed.
